# OpenScan Benchy - Let's all work together on a 3d scanner benchmark for desktop 3d scanners

# The Model

![Benchy01](https://github.com/OpenScanEu/OpenScanBenchy/assets/57842400/ad9864d0-46e4-43a4-9040-566df0b28306)

The original model was created by Valandar and can be downloaded [from Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2929718)

We slightly modified this model by adding some text to the base. Get the modified version [on Printables.com](https://www.printables.com/model/857818-openscan-benchy)

| Parameter | Value |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Bounding Box  | 49.4 x 36.6 x 45 mm  |
| Volume  | 8.65 cm3  |
| Surface  | 66.49 cm2  |
| Material  | Dark Gray Resin  |

We choose this model and fabrication method, as it represents a challenging real world use case for many scanners. The model has features at different scales, so that even high-end scanners should have a challenge ;)
The 3d printing process creates tiny artifacts (layer lines, support residue..), which should be visible on better scanning results.

# How to participate

## Get your printed 3d figurine
We provide printed models and offer free worldwide shipping. Just drop us a mail to info@openscan.eu or support the project by ordering your Benchy for 5€ (incl. worldwide shipping) [through our website openscan.eu](https://en.openscan.eu/product-page/openscan-benchy))

## Create and share your 3d scan
- create a unmodified .stl file and share the link on GitHub or [mail to info@openscan.eu](mailto:info@openscan.eu?subject=OpenScanBenchy)
- note, that by sharing the .stl file, you agree, that the file becomes part of this repository with the specified licence (GNU)
- specify your scanning setup and procedure
- if you want, add your (company) details, links, etc. if you want to be mentioned as the source

# Info and Transparency

This initiative was started by OpenScan but the content shown here comes from the community! We aim to create an easy to understand comparison of raw scan results from different 3d scanners. Instead of using pure, hard-to-verify numbers, we choose this little object which is generally challenging on different levels. This comparison is far from scientific, but we hope, that gathering data is a first step for a better overview and undstanding.

We highly encourage other 3D scanner manufacturers to participate to create a neutral comparison. Feel free to reach out at any time to [mail to info@openscan.eu](mailto:info@openscan.eu?subject=OpenScanBenchy). 

# Limitations

| Limitation/Issue | Reasoning | possible solution |
| -- | -- | -- |
| The 45mm resin print only represents a small spectrum of what most scanners are capable | this small object is easy and relatively cheap to produce and distribute | create other standardized objects for different size ranges |
| resin prints are not all perfectly equal | this creates common features which are hard to fake/alter, thus it shows the true capability of a scanner (e.g. are layer lines visible ...) | |
| the dark, partly glossy material might require some object preparation, which might alter the scanning result |intentional, as this is a good representation of a real-world challenging object | |
| the scan result is highly influenced by the user | | add more scan results from the same scanner from different users |
| this comparison does not show the time and effort put into the individual scan | True! but we need to start somewhere | better documentation, maybe some standard protocol? |
