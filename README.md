# OpenScan Benchy - Let's all work together on a 3d scanner benchmark for desktop 3d scanners

# The Model

![Benchy01](https://github.com/OpenScanEu/OpenScanBenchy/assets/57842400/ad9864d0-46e4-43a4-9040-566df0b28306)

The original model was created by Valandar and can be downloaded [from Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2929718)

We slightly modified this model by adding some text to the base. Get the modified version [on Printables.com](https://www.printables.com/model/857818-openscan-benchy)

| Parameter | Value |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Bounding Box  | 49.4 x 36.6 x 45 mm  |
| Volume  | 8.65 cm3  |
| Surface  | 66.49 cm2  |
| Material  | Dark Gray Resin  |

We choose this model and fabrication method, as it represents a challenging real world use case for many scanners. The model has features at different scales, so that even high-end scanners should have a challenge ;)
The 3d printing process creates tiny artifacts (layer lines, support residue..), which should be visible on better scanning results.
